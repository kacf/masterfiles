The debian package is already built. The general process
for adding new ones is as follows:

dpkg-deb --build <name of package>

rename the .deb file to <name of package>-<version number>_<architecture>.deb

Now to create the package in a local repo, edit the repo/conf/distributions and add your package so that it has a unique
set of parameters.

Copy your .deb package into the repo directory and run the putinrepo.sh:

./putinrepo/<package name>.debian

To recreate the repodata directory, run this on a RedHat host.

  $ sudo yum install createrepo
  $ createrepo .
